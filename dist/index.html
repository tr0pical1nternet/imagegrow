It may be used to display a sample of fonts, generate text for testing, or to spoof an e-mail spam filter. The process of using filler text is sometimes called greeking, although the text itself may be nonsense, or largely Latin, as in Lorem ipsum. </p><figure class="text-block__figure"><img src="https://www.cepolina.com/photo/technology/funfair/loop/5/loop-roller-coaster-curve-yellow.jpg" width="200" height="267"></figure><h3>Asdf</h3><p>ASDF is the sequence of letters that appear on the first four keys on the home row of a QWERTY or QWERTZ keyboard. They are often used as a sample or test case or as random, meaningless nonsense. It is also a common learning tool for keyboard classes, since all four keys are located on Home row. </p><h3>Etaoin shrdlu</h3><p>ETAOIN SHRDLU is the approximate order of frequency of the twelve most commonly used letters in the English language, best known as a nonsense phrase that sometimes appeared in print in the days of "hot type" publishing due to a custom of Linotype machine operators.</p><h3>Lorem Ipsum</h3><p>"Lorem ipsum..." is one of the most common filler texts, popular with typesetters and graphic designers. "Li Europan lingues..." is another similar example.</p><h3>Now is the time for all good men</h3><p>"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the country" is a phrase first proposed as a typing drill by instructor Charles E. Weller; its use is recounted in his book The Early History of the Typewriter, p. 21 (1918).[1] Frank E. McGurrin, an expert on the early Remington typewriter, used it in demonstrating his touch typing abilities in January 1889.[2] It has appeared in a number of typing books, often in the form "Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country."</p><h3>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h3><p>A coherent, short phrase that uses every letter of the alphabet. See pangram for more examples.</p><h3>New Petitions and Building Code</h3><p>Many B movies of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s utilized the "spinning newspaper" effect to narrate important plot points that occurred offscreen. The effect necessitated the appearance of a realistic front page, which consisted of a main headline relevant to the plot, and several smaller headlines used as filler. A large number of these spinning newspapers included stories titled "New Petitions Against Tax" and "Building Code Under Fire."[4] These phrases have become running jokes among B movie fans, and particularly fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000.</p></div><script src="imagegrow.js"></script></body></html>

It may be used to display a sample of fonts, generate text for testing, or to spoof an e-mail spam filter. The process of using filler text is sometimes called greeking, although the text itself may be nonsense, or largely Latin, as in Lorem ipsum. </p><figure class="text-block__figure imlarge"><img src="images/loop_180.jpg" width="200" height="267" srcset="images/loop_180.jpg 180w, images/loop_270.jpg 270w, images/loop_360.jpg 360w, images/loop_720.jpg 720w, images/loop_1080.jpg 1080w, images/loop_1200.jpg 1200w" alt="Rollercoaster loop"></figure><h3>Asdf</h3><p>ASDF is the sequence of letters that appear on the first four keys on the home row of a QWERTY or QWERTZ keyboard. They are often used as a sample or test case or as random, meaningless nonsense. It is also a common learning tool for keyboard classes, since all four keys are located on Home row. </p><h3>Etaoin shrdlu</h3><p>ETAOIN SHRDLU is the approximate order of frequency of the twelve most commonly used letters in the English language, best known as a nonsense phrase that sometimes appeared in print in the days of "hot type" publishing due to a custom of Linotype machine operators.</p><h3>Lorem Ipsum</h3><p>"Lorem ipsum..." is one of the most common filler texts, popular with typesetters and graphic designers. "Li Europan lingues..." is another similar example.</p><figure class="text-block__figure imlarge"><img src="images/fruit-loop_180.jpg" width="200" height="267" srcset="images/fruit-loop_180.jpg 180w, images/fruit-loop_270.jpg 270w, images/fruit-loop_360.jpg 360w, images/fruit-loop_720.jpg 720w, images/fruit-loop_1080.jpg 1080w" alt="Fruit loop"></figure><h3>Now is the time for all good men</h3><p>"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the country" is a phrase first proposed as a typing drill by instructor Charles E. Weller; its use is recounted in his book The Early History of the Typewriter, p. 21 (1918).[1] Frank E. McGurrin, an expert on the early Remington typewriter, used it in demonstrating his touch typing abilities in January 1889.[2] It has appeared in a number of typing books, often in the form "Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country."</p><h3>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h3><p>A coherent, short phrase that uses every letter of the alphabet. See pangram for more examples.</p><figure class="text-block__figure imlarge"><svg role="img" class="svg-icon button" aria-labelledby="close-title" focusable="false" width="32" height="32">

The effect necessitated the appearance of a realistic front page, which consisted of a main headline relevant to the plot, and several smaller headlines used as filler. A large number of these spinning newspapers included stories titled "New Petitions Against Tax" and "Building Code Under Fire."[4] These phrases have become running jokes among B movie fans, and particularly fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000.</p></div><script src="imlarge.js"></script></body></html>
